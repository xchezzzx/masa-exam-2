Export in JS means used to make a function or an object available from another  file or module.

 
## Part II: Practice on paper *=> 45 points*

*No restrictions on online resources usage. You also may use your development machine for assistance in debugging if needed.*

16. **You received a bug stating the following: "Intermittemtly this method results in an exception in the command line reporting of a Null reference." You're required to find and fix the problem in this method:** *=> 10 points*

		public static addWeeks(date: Date, value: number): Date {
            date.setDate(date.getDate() + (value * 7));
            return date;
        }

17. **Having the following DB tables diagram:** *=> 10 points*

![](https://github.com/lentyaishe/masa-exam-2/blob/dev/resources/db-schema.jpg)

You need to write a query that returns for each user a full data. Consider that not every user in the system has an employee record. In such a case out put "Not an employee". Create By column should include the full name of the user that created the record of this an output user:

| Full name | Created By | Position |
| --- | --- | -- |
| John Doe | Mark Smith | Manager |
| Mary Smith | Klark Smith | Cashier |
| Patrice Raymond | Mark Smith | Not an eployee |

 function copmareMonths(date1: Date, date2: Date): boolean {
        let result: boolean;
        if (date1.getMonth() === date2.getMonth())
                result = true;
        else 
                result = false;

        return result;

        public static dictionaryToArrayOfObjects<T>(input: _.Dictionary<T>): T[] {
            return _.map(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(input), (key: string) => input[key]);
        }

20. **Fix the following code and fill the required gaps in it by the coding standards. The purpose of this code is to verify the user is a member of a specific role and in case the user is, a true return value should be returned by the isUserPermitted() method, otherwise false. Treat the comments as actual code written that should not be changed.** *=> 15 points*

		interface user {
			id: number;
			firstName: string;
			lastName: string;
			roles: role;
		}
		
		interface dbUser {
			id: number;

			last_name: string;
			role_id: number;
			role_title

		interface role {
			id: number;
			title: string;
		}

		enum Role {
			Administrator = 1,
			RegularUser
		}
		
		public isUserPermitted(userId: number, roles: Role[]): Promise<bool> {
			return new Promise<bool>((resolve, reject) => {
				Promise.all([
					this.getUser(userId),
				])
				.then((user: user) => {
					resolve(user.roles.indexOf(roles[0]) > -1);
				});
			});
		}
		
		private getUser(userId: number): Promise<user> {
			return new Promise<user>((resolve, reject) => {
				// Access to the DB that returns the user data by id as dbUser or null
			});
		}


## Part III: Practice on dev machine *=> 33 points*

*No restrictions on online resources usage*

 - Clone the repository: https://github.com/lentyaishe/masa-exam-2;
 - Switch to `broken-server` branch;
 - Create a new git repository under your personal Github called `masa-exam-2`;
 - Load the `main` branch of your new repository with the contents of the `broken-server` branch;
 - Each bug in the list should be solved in designated branch.

The following is the list of currently existing problems with the system. :

21. **The server solution cannot be compiled. Fix all compilation issues accordingly.** *=> 10 points*

22. **An attempt to start the server fails reporting "RangeError [ERR_SOCKET_BAD_PORT]: options.port should be >= 0 and < 65536. Received NaN".** *=> 8 points*

23. **A request to an endpoint GET <serverUrl:port>/user/-1 crashes the server with "ECONNRESET" error.** *=> 5 points*

24. **Add the needed code in order to return a collection of teachers with the current `teacher` interface".** *=> 10 points*

# Good luck!!
